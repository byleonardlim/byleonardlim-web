## Details
The Allison featured in this story is a fictional character navigating very real challenges. As an independent AI Experience Designer on the product team, I've white-labeled all presentations and masked actual information—but the problems solved and value delivered are 100% authentic.

Across audit firms, professionals drown in information scattered across platforms, formats, and folders — client details here, meeting notes there, evidence documents somewhere else entirely. Every fragment contains potential gold for the final report, but mining and refining it? That's where the real work begins.
