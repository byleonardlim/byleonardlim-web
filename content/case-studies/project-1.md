## Notes
The Allison in this story is fictional, but her challenges are real. As an independent contributor AI Experience Designer in the product team, I've designed the solution using generative technology that transforms how auditors compile reports — from days to minutes.

While all information is white-labeled, the value delivered to audit teams is 100% authentic.

## Meet Allison
Allison's blank document stares back at her, the cursor blinking like a timer counting down billable hours. "Where should I start gathering all these findings?" she sighs, five minutes into her standoff with an empty draft.

This isn't just Allison's problem. Across audit firms, professionals drown in information scattered across platforms and formats — client details, meeting notes, and evidence documents living in digital diaspora. Every fragment contains gold for the final report, but mining it? That's the real work.

Before clients see anything polished, audit teams burn a full day just assembling a readable draft where precious hours spent hunting and gathering rather than analyzing and advising.

## Fast and Factually Correct
"The ask is simple—we need a way to trace findings back to their original source," says Allison. Client questions and partner reviews demand instant evidence to back up every claim.

When engagements grow complex, team members must become reference librarians on the fly, pulling precise citations from a digital labyrinth of documents. For each finding, Allison needs to recall exactly which file, which page, which paragraph contains the supporting evidence.

As engagements balloon with data, this mental mapping becomes unsustainable. What should be a simple "here's where we found this" turns into a frustrating treasure hunt through folders and files—the digital equivalent of searching for a specific sentence in a library without an index.


## Acheive The First 40% in Minutes
The solution lets Allison review issue points with the necessary citations, clearly showing how each finding was generated before flowing into Microsoft Word through a simple plug-in. 

AI-powered assistance lives right inside her everyday tools, not buried in some new platform she doesn't have time to learn. No switching between windows, no clunky interfaces to navigate. Just her familiar workflow, supercharged.

## Scaling Up
At the moment the solution is designed for risk auditors. As the generative model is matured, it will be opened up to various audit use case and potentially to other function in the organisation.
